# How to Create and Contribute a Skill

## Before you start: which repo?

> **Does your skill touch internal data or VPN-only systems?**
> Yes → [internal repo on GitLab](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/uxd/internal-ai-helpers)
> No or not sure → **this repo.** PR review will catch anything that should move.

## Step 1: Create your skill locally

Work in any project directory or an empty one — NOT in this repo.

```bash
mkdir my-skill-workspace
cd my-skill-workspace
```

Open your AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.):

```bash
claude  # or open the project in Cursor
```

## Step 2: Describe what you want

Describe what you want. Be specific about what the skill should do, what the output should look like, and who it's for. For example:

```
Create a skill called "component-doc" that generates a usage guide
from a React component's source code. It should output the component name,
a plain-language description of what it does, a list of its props with types,
and a basic usage example. Write it for someone who hasn't seen the component before.
```

This will create a `skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md` file.

## Step 3: Test it

Use the skill right there in your workspace:

```
/your-skill-name
```

Point it at a real file or scenario and see if the output is useful. If not, iterate:

```
The output is too verbose. Keep each section to 2-3 sentences max.
```

```
It's not explaining the props clearly enough. Add the default values.
```

Iterate until the output matches what you'd actually want to see.

## Step 4: Review your SKILL.md

Open the file and read it. It's just markdown. Ask yourself:

- Are the instructions clear enough that any AI tool would produce the same quality output?
- Is there anything tool-specific that wouldn't work in both Claude Code and Cursor?
- Is it under 500 lines? Shorter is better.

## Step 5: Pick the right plugin

Every skill or agent must live in a plugin. Pick the one that matches your skill's domain:

<!-- BEGIN PLUGIN TABLE -->
<table>
<tr><th>Plugin</th><th>What it does</th><th>Example skills</th></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>patternfly</b></td><td>Everything you need for PatternFly development — React components, design guidance, migration, and MCP docs</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>pf-assist</b></td><td>PatternFly skill routing — maps project signals to the right PF sub-skills for compliance, migration, and design audits</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>uxd-assist</b></td><td>UXD skill routing — discover the right skills for research, design review, and prototyping workflows</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>uxd-workshop</b></td><td>UXD team tools and skill incubator — prototyping, research, design review, team workflows</td><td>`uxd-design-handoff`, `uxd-discovery`, `uxd-evaluate-design-heuristics`</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>pf-a11y</b></td><td>Accessibility auditing, reporting, and documentation</td><td>`pf-a11y-audit`, `pf-a11y-keyboard`, `pf-a11y-test-gen`</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>pf-code-review</b></td><td>Code review and quality — adversarial review, security patterns</td><td>`pf-review`, `pf-security-scan`</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>pf-design-audit</b></td><td>Design audit — validate existing code and designs against PatternFly standards</td><td>`pf-ai-audit`, `pf-color-scan`, `pf-css-token-check`</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>pf-design-guide</b></td><td>Design guide — component selection, interaction patterns, AI experience patterns, Figma design creation</td><td>`pf-figma-design-mode`, `pf-screenshot-mapping`</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>pf-migration</b></td><td>PF version migration — breaking change detection, class scanning, upgrade planning</td><td>`pf-css-migration-scan`, `pf-react-migration-scan`, `pf-release-candidate-update`</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>pf-react</b></td><td>React component development — coding standards, testing, and structure</td><td>`pf-chart-gen`, `pf-component-check`, `pf-component-reuse-check`</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap><b>pf-workshop</b></td><td>PatternFly team tools and skill incubation — issue triage, release management, codebase auditing, new skill development</td><td>`pf-analytics-repo-pruning`, `pf-bug-triage`, `pf-content-review`</td></tr>
</table>
<!-- END PLUGIN TABLE -->

**How to decide:**
- Read the **What it does** column. Pick the plugin whose description best matches your skill's domain.
- If your skill matches multiple plugins, pick the one closest to its *primary input/output*.
- If it doesn't fit any plugin, open an issue to discuss creating a new one.

### Plugin naming standard

Plugin names must tell a user exactly what the plugin helps them do. A user browsing the marketplace should understand what they're installing without clicking through.

<!-- BEGIN GOOD NAMES -->
**Good names** describe the capability:
- `patternfly` — Everything you need for PatternFly development — React components, design guidance, migration, and MCP docs
- `pf-assist` — PatternFly skill routing — maps project signals to the right PF sub-skills for compliance, migration, and design audits
- `uxd-assist` — UXD skill routing — discover the right skills for research, design review, and prototyping workflows
- `pf-a11y` — Accessibility auditing, reporting, and documentation
- `pf-code-review` — Code review and quality — adversarial review, security patterns
- `pf-design-audit` — Design audit — validate existing code and designs against PatternFly standards
- `pf-design-guide` — Design guide — component selection, interaction patterns, AI experience patterns, Figma design creation
- `pf-mcp` — PatternFly MCP server — provides component documentation, design token lookup, and accessibility guidance via the Model Context Protocol
- `pf-migration` — PF version migration — breaking change detection, class scanning, upgrade planning
- `pf-react` — React component development — coding standards, testing, and structure
<!-- END GOOD NAMES -->

**Bad names** are vague categories:
- `workflow` — what workflow?
- `styling` — styling what? how?
- `ops` — too abstract

When proposing a new plugin, ask: *"If someone sees this name in a list, do they know what they're installing?"* If not, pick a more specific name. It's fine to create a plugin with only 1-2 skills if it represents a distinct domain — the taxonomy should reflect where the project is going, not just where it is today.

### Skill vs agent

- **Skill** — a task that produces a result: "generate tests," "audit for accessibility," "find an icon." Most contributions are skills.
- **Agent** — domain knowledge the AI follows: "always follow these coding standards," "when reviewing designs, always verify brand colors and 8px grid spacing." Only create an agent if it's foundational context that improves *every* interaction in that plugin's area.

**Litmus test:** Can someone use the result? Skill. Is it knowledge the AI should always follow? Agent. When in doubt, write a skill.

**They work together:** An agent's knowledge is loaded automatically when the AI detects relevant context. So if you invoke a skill like `pf-test-gen`, the `pf-coding-standards` agent's knowledge is also active — the agent makes the skill's output better.

## Naming convention

This repo uses two prefixes to distinguish skill domains:

| Prefix | Domain | When to use |
|--------|--------|------------|
| `pf-` | PatternFly-specific skills | Component development, PF testing, PF migration, design tokens |
| `uxd-` | UXD team skills | Prototyping, research, design review, team workflows |

All skills use a domain prefix — `pf-` for PatternFly, `uxd-` for UXD — regardless of how specific the skill is. This ensures consistent discoverability when searching or browsing the skill list.

| Type | Domain? | Plugin | Name |
|------|---------|--------|------|
| Skill | PF — generates PF component tests | `react` | `pf-test-gen` |
| Skill | PF — PF design token auditing | `design-audit` | `pf-figma-token-check` |
| Skill | PF — summarizes PR reviews | `pf-workshop` | `pf-summarize-pr-reviews` |
| Skill | UXD — creates prototypes | `uxd-workshop` | `uxd-prototype-create` |
| Skill | UXD — retrieves research insights | `uxd-workshop` | `uxd-research-insights` |
| Agent | PF — PF React coding standards | `react` | `pf-coding-standards` |
| Agent | UXD — workflow routing | `uxd-workshop` | `uxd-assist` |

**Why this matters:** When slash commands appear in a flat list, the prefix tells you at a glance which domain a skill serves. In Claude Code, skills show the plugin namespace (`/react:pf-test-gen`), but the prefix is still valuable for cross-tool consistency.

**The directory name, file name, and frontmatter `name` must all match.** A mismatch causes confusing behavior when invoking the skill.
- Skill directory: `skills/pf-test-gen/SKILL.md` with `name: pf-test-gen`
- Agent file: `agents/pf-coding-standards.md` with `name: pf-coding-standards`

### Verb suffixes

End your skill name with one of these four verbs, unless the name is already a recognizable process.

| Suffix | Meaning | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `-gen` | Produces a new artifact that didn't exist before | `pf-test-gen`, `pf-form-gen`, `pf-project-gen` |
| `-review` | Examines existing work and provides judgment-based feedback | `pf-design-review` |
| `-audit` | Validates an existing artifact against fixed rules or a reference catalog | `pf-ai-audit`, `pf-color-scan`, `pf-component-check` |
| `-migrate` | Transforms code or designs from one version to another | `pf-migrate` |

**Decision tree:**

1. Is the skill name already a recognizable process (e.g., discovery, synthesis, handoff, triage)? → suffix optional
2. Does your skill produce something new? → `-gen`
3. Does your skill check existing work with judgment? → `-review`
4. Does your skill validate against fixed rules? → `-audit`
5. Does your skill transform code between versions? → `-migrate`

If none of these fit, open a PR proposing a new verb. Justify why the four core verbs don't apply — the bar is high. When in doubt, add the suffix — clarity over brevity.

**Note:** Some existing skills use older suffixes (`-check`, `-scan`, `-setup`, `-read`) that predate this convention. These map to the core verbs: `-check` and `-scan` → `-audit`, `-setup` and `-create` → `-gen`, `-read` → `-review`.

## Writing descriptions

Every skill and agent needs a `description` in its frontmatter. This description is how the AI decides whether to load the skill — it's the single most important line in your SKILL.md.

### Formula

**[Action verb] [what it does]. [Use when + trigger contexts.]**

### Rules

1. **Start with an action verb** — Audit, Generate, Scan, Create, Validate, Find, Recommend. Not "Guide for," "Performs," "Enables," "A tool that."
2. **One sentence for what it does** — the capability, not the implementation.
3. **One sentence for when to use it** — "Use when" followed by 2-3 trigger scenarios separated by commas or "or."
4. **No keyword lists** — the AI handles semantic matching. Don't pad with synonyms.
5. **Front-load the key use case** — AI tools [truncate skill descriptions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md) to fit a context budget. Put the most important trigger context first so it survives truncation.

### Examples

**Good:**

```yaml
description: Audit focus traps, restoration, and screen reader announcements. Use when building modals, dialogs, or wizards that manage focus programmatically.
```

**Good:**

```yaml
description: Generate unit tests for React components. Use when creating new components, adding test coverage, or refactoring existing tests.
```

**Bad — starts with a weak verb:**

```yaml
description: A comprehensive guide for component structure auditing and debugging.
```

**Bad — keyword stuffing:**

```yaml
description: Tool for testing, unit testing, component testing, React testing, PatternFly testing, jest testing.
```

### Agent descriptions

Agents are domain knowledge, not tasks — their descriptions follow a different pattern.

**[Domain noun] [what it covers]. [Active when + context.]**

No action-verb lead-in. Use "Active when" instead of "Use when" — agents aren't invoked, they're contextually loaded.

**Good:**

```yaml
description: PatternFly React coding standards — import patterns, component composition, token usage, and style conventions. Active when writing, reviewing, or refactoring PF React code.
```

**Bad — uses skill formula on an agent:**

```yaml
description: Define PatternFly React coding standards. Use when writing or reviewing PF React code.
```

## How the repo is structured

```

Each AI tool looks for its own directory (`.claude-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`) to find `marketplace.json`, which lists plugins with relative paths. UXD plugins live at `plugins/<name>/`. PatternFly plugins live under `plugins/patternfly/<name>/`. Each plugin has identical manifests in both `.claude-plugin/` and `.cursor-plugin/` directories. Adding support for a new tool means copying the manifest into a new `.<tool>-plugin/` directory.

## Step 6: Contribute it

Once you're happy with the skill:

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Copy your `SKILL.md` into the appropriate plugin's `skills/` directory (e.g., `plugins/patternfly/react/skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md` for PF skills, or `plugins/<uxd-plugin>/skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md` for UXD skills)
3. Open a pull request

Your skill becomes available as `/<plugin-name>:your-skill-name` for anyone who installs the plugin.

## Writing skills

For guidance on writing effective skills — structure, descriptions, examples, evaluation, and bundled resources — see Anthropic's [skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/skill-creator) plugin (also installable via `/plugin install skill-creator@claude-plugins-official`).

### Requirements for this repo

In addition to the skill-creator guidance, skills in this repo must follow these rules:

- **Frontmatter is required** with `name` and `description`. The `name` must match the directory name. See [Writing descriptions](#writing-descriptions) for the description formula.
- Add `disable-model-invocation: true` if your skill has side effects (creates issues, posts comments, deploys)
- **Describe outcomes, not implementation** — tell the AI what to accomplish, not how to do it. The AI already knows how to use `git`, `gh`, `grep`, etc.
- **Skills must be tool-agnostic** — they run in both Claude Code and Cursor. Avoid referencing a specific tool (e.g., use "Assistant:" instead of "Claude:" in examples).
- **Prefer bash** for bundled scripts — every user has it, no runtime dependency. If a script requires Node.js or Python, declare it in a `## Requirements` section and fail with a clear error if missing:
  ```bash
  command -v node >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "Error: This skill requires Node.js." >&2; exit 1; }
  ```
- Use `$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` to reference scripts relative to the skill directory — it resolves to the directory containing SKILL.md regardless of where the repo is cloned

### MCP dependencies

Treat MCP servers as **enhancements, not requirements** unless the skill's entire purpose is MCP orchestration (e.g., `pf-figma-design-mode`).

- **Use "if available" fallback language.** If MCP enriches your skill but isn't essential, say so: *"If `@patternfly/patternfly-mcp` is available, use it for current props and examples."* See `pf-component-check` for the pattern.
- **Don't claim MCP as required when it isn't.** If your skill works fine without MCP, don't put "Requires MCP" in the description.
- **Separate decisions from execution.** Even MCP-driven skills make decisions (component selection, layout structure) before calling MCP tools. Your skill's judgment should be testable without MCP connected.

### Skill maturity

Skills use a `version` field in frontmatter to signal maturity:

| Version | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `0.x.0` | Draft — functional but not yet reviewed or validated. |
| `1.0.0` | Evals passing and team has approved the version bump via PR. |

Version signals maturity within whatever plugin the skill lives in — it does not determine who the skill is for. Which plugin a skill belongs to determines that (e.g., workshop plugins are team tools and incubating skills, consumer plugins are for anyone). A skill can reach `1.0.0` in a workshop plugin and stay there, or graduate to a consumer plugin.

A `1.0.0` bump requires evals regardless of which plugin the skill lives in. Bump when the skill materially changes, not on every edit.

### Evals

Evals are **expected** for consumer-facing skills. A skill graduating from a workshop to a consumer plugin should have an eval that proves its value.

Write test cases that target what the skill **uniquely contributes** — don't test things the base model already knows without the skill loaded. Good eval cases are *discriminating*: they should fail (or produce noticeably worse output) without the skill loaded.

Evals use [agent-eval-harness](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness) and are colocated with their skill at `skills/<skill-name>/eval/eval.yaml`. See `plugins/patternfly/react/skills/pf-test-gen/eval/eval.yaml` for a working example. To run evals locally, install the harness plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install agent-eval-harness@agent-eval-harness-dev
```

### Skillsaw

[Skillsaw](https://github.com/stbenjam/skillsaw) is an open-source linter for AI coding agent context files — skills, agents, and manifests. It runs automatically on every PR and checks for issues a human reviewer would miss: weak language, attention dead zones (critical instructions buried in the middle of long files), token budget overruns, embedded secrets, contradictions, and placeholder text.

**You don't need to install anything.** Skillsaw runs in CI and posts annotations directly on your PR. If you want to run it locally before pushing:

```bash
make lint
```

This uses `uvx` (zero-install) to run skillsaw against the repo. You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed.

Skillsaw findings are **advisory, not blocking** — your PR won't be held up by warnings. But addressing them makes your skill more effective when an AI agent consumes it.

Existing violations are baselined. You'll only see issues introduced by your changes.

### AI Guardian

[AI Guardian](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/ai-guardian) scans bundled scripts and skill files for security issues that content linters miss: credential exfiltration patterns, code vulnerabilities (via bandit/semgrep), and prompt injection attacks.

**You don't need to install anything.** AI Guardian runs in CI on every PR that touches `plugins/`. If you want to run it locally:

```bash
make security
```

This uses `uvx` (zero-install) to run AI Guardian against the plugins directory. You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed.

AI Guardian findings are **blocking** — address them before merge.

*A cross-team collaboration with [Red Hat Product Security](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity).*

### Security rules

Skills are instructions that an AI tool follows on behalf of a user. Contributors must not include instructions that:

- Hardcode secrets, tokens, or credentials
- Tell the AI to disable permission prompts or skip verification (`--no-verify`, `--force`) in skill instructions or bundled scripts
- Send data to external services without explicit user confirmation
- Use `eval`, `exec`, or `curl | bash` patterns in bundled scripts
- Access files outside the target project without stating why

Bundled scripts (`.sh`, `.js`, `.py`, `.ts`) are reviewed for these patterns automatically by CodeRabbit and [AI Guardian](#ai-guardian). See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for the full review process.
