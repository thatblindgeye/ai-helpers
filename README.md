AI skills for PatternFly and UXD teams — component development, design, accessibility, and migration. Skills work in both **Claude Code** and **Cursor**; the `patternfly` meta-plugin is Claude Code-only. All consumer-facing skills include eval suites with discriminating judges.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

Add the marketplace and install the `patternfly` meta-plugin — it auto-installs all PatternFly sub-plugins in one step:

```bash
# Add the marketplace (one time)
claude plugins marketplace add rh-uxd/ai-helpers

# Install everything PatternFly (React, design guide, audit, migration, and MCP)
claude plugins install patternfly@uxd-ai-helpers
```

That's it — all PatternFly skills are now available as slash commands:

```
/pf-react:pf-test-gen          # Generate unit tests for a React component
/pf-design-guide:pf-ai-guide   # Get AI experience design guidance
/pf-design-audit:pf-color-scan # Scan for hardcoded colors that should be tokens
```

<details>
<summary>See the install flow</summary>

</details>

**Individual plugins:** Install only what you need (e.g., `claude plugins install pf-react@uxd-ai-helpers`). Don't install both `patternfly` and individual sub-plugins — `patternfly` already includes them.

Enable auto-update to receive new skills as they're merged:

`/plugin` → Marketplaces → enable auto-update

### Cursor

Install the plugins you need — see the [Plugins](#plugins) table below for the full list. Add the marketplace in **Settings → Marketplace**, then install individually:

After installing, skills work the same way — slash commands in any project:

```
/pf-react:pf-test-gen          # Generate unit tests for a React component
/pf-design-audit:pf-color-scan # Scan for hardcoded colors that should be tokens
```

For MCP server access (component docs and design tokens), also install `pf-mcp`. See the [FAQ](FAQ.md#how-do-i-test-a-skill-without-the-patternfly-mcp-server) for setup.

## How It Works

1. You add this repo as a **marketplace** in Claude Code or Cursor
2. You install plugins — on Claude Code, `patternfly` auto-installs all PF sub-plugins; on Cursor, pick the ones you need
3. Skills become available as `/<plugin>:<skill>` slash commands in any project

## PatternFly MCP Server

The [PatternFly MCP server](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-mcp) gives AI tools access to component documentation, prop schemas, and design guidelines. On Claude Code, `pf-mcp` is included automatically when you install `patternfly`. On Cursor, the MCP server requires [separate setup](FAQ.md#how-do-i-test-a-skill-without-the-patternfly-mcp-server).

## CI/CD

Every pull request runs through automated quality gates:

| Gate | What it checks |
|------|---------------|
| **Validate** | Manifest consistency, generated docs freshness, skill frontmatter integrity |
| **Skillsaw** | Skill content quality — structure, clarity, completeness |
| **Eval lint** | Eval config correctness — schema validation, judge quality |
| **Eval required** | Consumer-facing skills must include an eval suite |
| **AI Guardian** | Security scanning for prompt injection, unsafe patterns |
| **Secret scan** | Internal URLs and potential credentials in tracked files |
| **Link check** | Broken internal markdown links |
| **Boundary check** | PF skills don't reference UXD internals and vice versa |
| **CodeRabbit** | Automated review — structure, security patterns, best practices |
